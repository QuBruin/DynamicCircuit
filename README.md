## YML setup with conda

Use conda to replicate environment from the .yml file

``` 
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

replace `environment.yml` with the path to the .yml file. Conda will create a new environment based on the specifications in your YAML file.

``` bash
conda activate my_env
```

Use this to activate the conda environment that you just created. Replace `my_env` with the name of your environment.
